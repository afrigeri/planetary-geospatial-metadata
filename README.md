# Geospatial Metadata for planetary data.  

Geospatial metadata to make planetary data iteroperable and discoverable.

Application to the Oxia Planum morpho-stratigraphic mapping exercise for ExoMars2022.

Testing: _iso19139_ which is the XML implementation of ISO19115 (EU/INSPIRE compatible). ArcPro can generate this as well.

Here we generate the _iso19139_ xml from plain yml files (via pygeometa). 

 * Metadata for basemaps
	- CTX and HiRISE mosaics

 * Metadata for interpretative mapping
	- morpho-stratigraphic mapping.
